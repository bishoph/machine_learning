tensorflow:

 Softmax classification of the Iris dataset with Tensorflow.
 Loading the dataset and also encoding the one-hot label 
 manually for better understanding. After the dataset training 
 we generate random test sets and run them to get either 
 probabilities and predictions from the learned data.

sklearn:

 Simple Nearest Neighbors algorithm used in combination with the 
 Iris dataset. Even if our dataset is small, the ball tree 
 classification is used. We generate random test sets and get 
 predictions based upon uniform and distance weighting.
